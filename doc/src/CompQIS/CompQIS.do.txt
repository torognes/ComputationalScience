TITLE: Computational Science: Quantum Information Science and Technology
AUTHOR: Computational Science program, University of Oslo
DATE: Planned start: Fall 2025


===== Why Quantum Information Science and Technology  =====

Quantum Information Science and Technology is an emerging field with
the potential to produce revolutionary advances in fields of science
and engineering involving computation, communication, precision
measurement, and fundamental quantum science.


===  The Quantum Information Science and technology study option ===

The field of Quantum Information Science and Technology  brings
together two major advances of the 20th century: quantum mechanics and
information technology.

Quantum mechanics is the most accurate theory in science. It describes
the world at its most basic level. Information technology gave rise to
the computer, digital communication and other devices that have
transformed how we live. When we combine quantum mechanics and
information technology we get Quantum Information Science and
Technology.

Quantum Information Science and Technology will harness the power of
quantum mechanics and bring a radical new era of technology. It will
allow us to do things that are unthinkable or even impossible with
today’s technology. Quantum technologies will fundamentally change
classical engineering paradigms in computing, information processing,
and measurement technology.

With this study option you can deepen your knowledge on quantum
mechanics with a broad range of possibilities, from the mathematics of
quantum information science to quantum engineering and devising
quantum gates and circuits, in close cooperation with experimental
environments.


===== Program options CS: Quantum Information Science and Technology =====

===  structure of the option CS: Quantum Information Science and Technology ===

The program option Quantum Information Science and Technology is built
around a Master's thesis, which is an independent scientific research
work of 60 ECTS credits, and six courses with a total of 60 ECTS
credits.

The program contains mandatory courses. For general structure and
mandatory requirements, please see the program structure.

=== Recommended courses ===

Courses with a focus on quantum mechanics, quantum information theory and quantum technologies

FYS4110 – Modern Quantum Mechanics

===== Career opportunities =====

A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century workforce.

Many companies are seeking individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and computational modeling. And candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.

=== Unique knowledge in the labour market ===
The computational methods and approaches to scientific problems that you will learn when working on your thesis project are very similar to the methods you will use in later stages of your career. To handle large numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This knowledge makes you unique in the labour market.

=== A wide range of work places ===

Career opportunities are many, from research institutes and laboratories, universities and university colleges and a multitude of companies. The program gives an excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible goal.
